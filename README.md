* The most significant variables in our dataset which show a non-random effect on the MPG of the MechaCar are the Vehicle Length and the Ground Clearance.
* The Slope of the linear model connot be considered as there is significant variation in the P-Level (5.35e-11) in my opinion the null hypothesis should be rejected.
* The r-squared value of 0.7149 indicates that the model is 71% accurate. Meaning the model does provide some effectiveness although more data could provide a higher r-squared value.

*Lot 1 and 2 meet manufacturing specifications as the variance and Sd are both under 100 pounds while lot 3 is not

* As we can see the overall p-value for lot 1 is (1) which is outside the significance level of 1 as is lot 2 (.6072) The only lot with a p-level under .5 is lot 3. Resulting in a confidence interval of 95 percent. Meaning there is not enough data to reject the null hypothesis. Also the dataset mean and the population mean are statistically similar.
