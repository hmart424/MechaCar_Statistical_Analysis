* The most significant variables in our dataset which show a non-random effect on the MPG of the MechaCar are the Vehicle Length and the Ground Clearance.
* The Slope of the linear model connot be considered as there is significant variation in the P-Level (5.35e-11) in my opinion the null hypothesis should be rejected.
* The r-squared value of 0.7149 indicates that the model is 71% accurate. Meaning the model does provide some effectiveness although more data could provide a higher r-squared value.
